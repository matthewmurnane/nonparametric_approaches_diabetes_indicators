#The results showed a statistically significant difference in BMI among the three diabetes groups
#This suggests that mean BMI significantly varies depending on diabetes status. However, to determine which specific groups differ, a post-hoc test such as Tukey's HSD should be performed.

#Assumptions check

#Normality of residuals (Shapiro-Wilk test and Q-Q plot)

#Due to the large sample size, the Shapiro-Wilk test could not be used. Instead, visual inspection of the Q-Q plot and histogram of residuals suggests that the assumption of normality is reasonably satisfied, as the residuals appear approximately normally distributed.
# Q-Q plot
qqnorm(residuals(anova_model))
qqline(residuals(anova_model), col = "red")
#The plot shows noticeable deviations from the red reference line at both tails, indicating some departure from normality, especially in the upper and lower extremes of the residuals.

#Homogeneity of variances (Leveneâ€™s Test)

#p-value is extremely small (way less than 0.05), so we reject the null hypothesis of equal variances.

#Post-Hoc Test (as ANOVA is significant)

#all pairwise differences in mean BMI among the three diabetes groups are statistically significant at the 0.05 level

#Since the variances are not equal, the regular ANOVA could be biased
#We use Welch's ANOVA, which does not assume equal variances and is better suited when this assumption is violated
