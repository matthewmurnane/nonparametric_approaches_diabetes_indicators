Important Risk FactorsÂ¶

Research in the field has identified the following as important risk factors for diabetes and other chronic illnesses like heart disease (not in strict order of importance):

blood pressure (high)
cholesterol (high)
smoking
diabetes
obesity
age
sex
race
diet
exercise
alcohol consumption
BMI
Household Income
Marital Status
Sleep
Time since last checkup
Education
Health care coverage
Mental Health
Selected Subset of Features from BRFSS 2015

Given these risk factors, I tried to select features (columns/questions) in the BRFSS related to these risk factors. To help understand what the columns mean, I consult the BRFSS 2015 Codebook to see the questions and information about the questions. I try to match the variable names in the codebook to the variable names in the dataset I downloaded from Kaggle. I also reference some of the same features chosen for a research paper by Zidian Xie et al for Building Risk Prediction Models for Type 2 Diabetes Using Machine Learning Techniques using the 2014 BRFSS.
